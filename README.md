# Tailwind CSS Class Application Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes don't seem to be applying correctly, resulting in unexpected styling.  The issue revolves around background colors not rendering as expected despite what appears to be valid class usage.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a potential solution and explanation.

## Bug

The primary issue lies within the styling of a div element. While the intention is to set a light gray background using `bg-gray-100`, the rendered color is different.  This inconsistency is investigated and resolved in the solution file.

## Solution

The solution often involves checking the following:

1. **Correct Import/Configuration:** Ensure Tailwind CSS is correctly imported and configured in your project.
2. **Purge Configuration (If Using):** If you're using PurgeCSS or a similar tool, verify that the necessary classes are being included in the final CSS output.
3. **CSS Specificity:**  If other stylesheets or inline styles might override Tailwind's classes, address those conflicts by ensuring proper specificity.
4. **Caching:** Clear browser cache and restart the development server to ensure updated styles are applied.
5. **Typographical Errors:** Double-check for any typos in the class names.
6. **Conflicting CSS Framework:** Check for any possibility of conflicts if another CSS framework is being used alongside Tailwind.
